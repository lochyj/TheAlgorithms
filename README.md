# The Algorithms
The Algorithms repo

## Rules

1. The algorithm must be placed under a folder with the name of the algorithm it is implementing. An example algorithm would be:
- `binary_search`       <- Folder
    - `binary_search.py`    <- File
    - `binary_search.cpp`   <- File
    - `binary_search.go`    <- File
